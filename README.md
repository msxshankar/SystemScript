# SystemScript
A collection of useful scripts for Linux computers.

## update.sh
Updates system packages based on disto and package manager.
For now, built for Pop!-OS as this is my daily driver, but will add support for other distos.

## How to use

Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/msxshankar/BashScript
```

Set script to executable:
```
chmod 755 update.sh
```

Run script:
```
./update.sh
```
You can add this script to your bin directory so you can just type update.sh in the future!
Feel free to rename this file from update.sh to update (The .sh extension is for clarity).
